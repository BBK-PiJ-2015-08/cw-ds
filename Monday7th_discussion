Have to be able to test our code.

List.java
two possible things to return - an address, or null.
Point of this - 
1. get used to structuring of classes and interfaces
2. Test things properly - use a manual script.
3. Avoid NullPointerExceptions

Code must work without throwing any exceptions <- CANNOT use throw exceptions - get around with an if statement and don't break it. if (between range) do x, otherwise {custom error; using enum}

You must run a battery of tests in order to try to pass your own tests; this is to try to get top marks

Test-driven-development: First write the tests that you expect your code to pass. This involves writing every single combination you expect.
